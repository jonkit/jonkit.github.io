Here's the fifth <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/wiltrn-005/pl.u-le7kjlFjMDqkk">What I'm Listening To Right Now</a> playlist: 

1. The 1975 - Me & You Together Song
2. Fickle Friends - Pretty Great
3. Tove Lo - Bikini Porn
4. The Naked and Famous - Sunseeker
5. Soccer Mommy - circle the drain
6. Dean Lewis - Hold of Me
7. Phoebe Bridgers - Smoke Signals

<br />
Iâ€™ve sat on this playlist for a little while so some of the songs arenâ€™t too new. I listened to it a couple times over the last few days and Pretty Great, Sunseeker, and Circle the Drain are still standouts. 

If youâ€™re into music, podcasts, or behind-the-scenes stuff (ideally all three), check out the recent Song Exploder podcast with Soccer Mommy talking about Circle the Drain.
