I love this response whenever someone is asking why they should do something or think differently about equality. It is not someone else’s responsibility to inform them of why they ​are wrong.

Assuming the best of people is something you get  to do because you haven’t been kicked in the gut. This shit has been happening for his whole fucking life. He knows what it is. How about assuming the best of him and his judgement of the situation?

> There’s a lot of benefit to that doubt. It can entrench those with power or it can balance the scales. You get to decide where it goes. When you’re making that call, err on the side of the people whose balance is light.

That is a great way to approach this.
