> Most photographers will go out of their way to avoid lens flares by using hoods or shades around their lenses. But if the Sun is in your frame or right next to it, it can be impossible to avoid.

I posted a [photo](http://theonlysiteever.com/partial-eclipse-2017) I took of the partial eclipse and noted there was some kind of reflection that actually showed the eclipse. It was lens flare.
