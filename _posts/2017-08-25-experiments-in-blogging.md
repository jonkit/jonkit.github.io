Stop me if you have heard this one before, but for the last ten years I have wanted to create a blog like [John Gruber’s](https://twitter.com/gruber) [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net).  

I am not a writer. I am not famous (internet or otherwise). I do not have unique or insightful opinions about things. Yet still I continue to want to have my own website that people willingly visit on a regular basis[^1-expe].  

My previously failed attempts include, but are not limited to:

+ A site based around curating Spotify playlists focusing on Canadian bands called [SpotEH!fy](http://jonkit.ca/cdn/photos/2017-08-25-spotehfy_01.png)
+ A rip-off the once-great-but-now-gone Evening Edition website, but with a focus on Canadian news called The Abridged
+ A linked-list style blog focusing on Canadian politics called [One Hundred Eleven](http://jonkit.ca/cdn/photos/2017-08-25-onehundredeleven_01.png)
+ A weekly review of a single album called New Music Tuesday
+ Several (as in easily more than four) [attempts](http://jonkit.ca/cdn/photos/2017-08-25-theonlysiteever_01.png) at this very format of original posts and linked-list posts using this URL
+ A photography website showcasing some photos I took when I masqueraded as a concert photographer 
+ Another photography site showcasing more general photos I took

I came to learn that much like dating, I found the thrill of the chase more intriguing than actually running a website. These sites lasted weeks, at most. Some lasted mere days.  

I started the current iteration of this site at the beginning of the year and when I inevitably abandoned it, not only did I *not* delete it, I actually setup a private README file for my future-self so I could just pick-up where I left-off without having to re-do the entire site. 

I also have come to terms with my own limitations. A while ago I noticed that Ben Brooks setup a [website](http://benb.me) to which he posted snippets of text... not quite tweets but definitely not full blog posts, and that intrigued me. In all of my failed attempts, I rarely wrote a full-length blog post but the idea of a quick quip seemed like something I could handle.  

Enter [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog) - a microblogging/IndieWeb/feed compiler service from [Manton Reece](http://manton.org)[^2-expe] - that I backed on Kickstarter[^3-expe] many months ago. I did not really know what it was, but it seemed like it lined up with the idea of easily posting text to the internet.... After a few weeks of fixing my RSS feeds to cross-post to Micro.blog and figuring out some iOS automations to help upload photos and make quick posts, I am actually in a position to give this a shot.  

I am hoping that by having the ability to create these small pieces of content it may create a habit that will lead to creating longer pieces of content. My expectations, however, are that I will predominantly post photos and rarely write full-length blog posts. Brief text posts and linked-list posts will be somewhere in the middle. We will see how it goes... 

[^1-expe]: I say that mostly sarcastically. I know it is the wrong way to approach it. I really like the idea of writing things (I say idea because I have never really given it an honest effort) and I know I should just focus on doing this just because I want to write

[^2-expe]: It should be obvious by that terrible explanation that I don’t have a solid understanding of what Micro.blog is

[^3-expe]: I previously backed [App.net](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net), so backing Micro.blog did not feel like an odd thing to do
