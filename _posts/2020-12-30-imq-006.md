So here‚Äôs, give or take, my favourite tracks for the year. I wrote a whole thing for the newsletter if you want to see more detail (including my favourite albums!). I could have cheated - going through other people‚Äôs top lists I noticed a few albums that I just outright missed this year - but this list is of my actual favourite albums and tracks that I actually knew were released and actually listened to. 

This playlist is a part of a music newsletter I‚Äôve started called Notes on Notes. Check out the [newsletter here](https://notesnotes.substack.com/). Of course it‚Äôs on Substack.
