Mark Wolinski writing about why you should edit photos: 

> In photography, the word “edit” has – unfortunately – two meanings. The first is the post-production work you do on a photo: cropping, adjusting white balance, changing exposure, contrast, brightness, and so on. You may or may not do this with your photos before you show them to other people; in fact, most people don’t.

With the tools available to me on the iPhone there really is no excuse to not do this. It may seem daunting, but an edited photo - even if it is just leveling and cropping - will stand out.

> The second meaning of the word “edit” is very different: it’s about editing a body of work. Let’s say you’ve taken a trip to a tropical island, and shot 500 photos. If you want to show them to friends, it’s a good idea to cull them, because no one – and I mean no one – will want to sit through all your pictures.

Going hand-in-hand with the first meaning, the second meaning may be even more important. After my wife and I had our kid, I - unsurprisingly - have seen my photo library explode. I do not expect to edit this down to just A++ shots, but even just removing duplicates and wasted shots would noticeably cut down the amount of photos. As an added bonus - removing unnecessary photos makes the first kind of editing even easier. If you only leave yourself with average-to-above-average photos, selecting the very best to edit is much easier.
