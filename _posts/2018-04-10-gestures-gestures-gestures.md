title: "Gestures, Gestures, Gestures"

tl;dr I know what I’d do, but I have given this 1000x less thought than the people who would be responsible for the actual decision and I’m sure I’m overlooking a lot of things.

<p class="separator">&#10048; &#10048; &#10048;</p>

The [debate](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17196846/apple-ipad-gesture-changes-iphone-x) about gesture consistency between iPhone and iPad is a fun one because without knowing what Apple’s plans are for future hardware and software, there are a bunch of possible solutions - it relies on making a lot of assumptions. Naturally, this leads to a lot of, “Well obviously the solution is X” kind of posts.

Well, here’s the obvious solution...

+ basic swipe up from the bottom (like current iPhone X behaviour) brings you to the home screen
+ swipe half-way up/swipe up and pause (like a hybrid of that gesture on iOS 11 iPads and iPhone X) brings up multi-tasking and Control Center ... and on iPad it also brings up the dock

<br />

That’s it. The solution is closer to the gestures on iPhone X than it is on iOS 11 iPads but it’s enough of a tweak to help with muscle memory issues people seem to be having. Like [Federico](https://www.macstories.net/linked/an-ipad-gesture-dilemma/), even though this does align the behaviour on iPhone and iPad, I do not think that Apple *needs* to make sure they mirror each other. If they can, great, but I’d rather them tailor the gestures to best suit the device wherever possible[^1-gestures].

### What about multitasking on iPads? 

It will change, slightly... you lose the ability to quickly bring up the dock and drag an app onto the current app to initiate split-view or slide-over multitasking. Instead, you would swipe up and pause and then with the dock visible you would drag and drop an app from the dock onto the thumbnail of the app you want to multitask with[^2-gestures].  

I would tweak the multitasking to allow you to drag and drop a thumbnail (within the multitasking view) onto another thumbnail to initiate the multitasking.  

### Anything else impacted?

Multitasking and Control Center are already combined on iPads but there isn’t enough screen real estate on iPhones for a full-fledged Control Center alongside the multitasking view. I would expect it to be a condensed version with the full Control Center still accessible in its current location. Apple has - at the very least - experimented with this. The video is the tweet below from [Guilherme Rambo](https://mobile.twitter.com/_inside) from the HomePod firmware leak shows a very similar multitasking view on iPhone.

Dragging and dropping files would still work as it does now - dragging the file over an app would launch the app and you could initiate a drag, pull-up the multitasking view, and drag the file over the app thumbnail to launch the app. 

Presuming iPhones (or iPads) with a home button stick around, the single click would take you to the home screen and the double-click would bring up the multitasking and Control Center view. 

Though not necessarily a priority to consider, it’s worth remembering that watchOS and tvOS do exist and both rely on swipe gestures. I don’t think there is much overlap  to worry about coordinating with, but I also haven’t really given it much thought.

And if we really want to get into discussing possible solutions to things, lets talk about how to improve using multitasking on iPad using only a keyboard...

[^1-gestures]: Like having the swipe across the bottom of the screen to switch apps on iPhone X vs the four-finger swipe to do the same on iPad.  

[^2-gestures]: You can already do that now from the current iOS 11 iPad multitasking view.
