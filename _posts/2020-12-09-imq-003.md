This playlist is a part of a music newsletter Iâ€™ve started called Notes on Notes. Check out the [newsletter here](https://notesnotes.substack.com/). Of course itâ€™s on Substack.

Three standout tracks from some new albums, three new tracks from soon-to-be-released albums, and a few others that Iâ€™ve just been listening to a lot. I canâ€™t believe I missed the Jessie Reyez album earlier this year. Itâ€™s good.
