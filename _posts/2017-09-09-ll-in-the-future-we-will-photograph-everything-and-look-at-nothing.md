> In the future, he said, the “real value creation will come from stitching together photos as a fabric, extracting information and then providing that cumulative information as a totally different package.”

I am not sure this was the intention of the quote but it made me think of AI in photo editing and all of the transformative things it can do. I can already imagine the negative response to it but I find it fascinating. 

My first example is not AI but compositing two photos to make a single photo. On the surface it looks fake. It looks doctored. It looks... amazing. This photographer took two photos and stitched them together to make a photo more interesting than either of the two individual photos on their own.  

This was taken during the most recent eclipse in Toronto. Here is a link to the [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/jonsimo/) of the person who took it.

This other example I came across last week *is* an AI application. By taking different focal lengths and combining them, the distances and size of objects that have been captured can be altered to create a more appealing photo. [Here is the YouTube video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NBpzYH9sT0s).

This is the kind of thing that will make photographers feel weird... but I am positive it is not the first time that something new has made an established group feel uncomfortable.
