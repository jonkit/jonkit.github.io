> In today’s world, more so than ever, we value the now. Real time. 24/7. But this is, by definition, short-sighted. History will not judge us by the hot takes, because history won’t give a shit. History has the benefit of hindsight.

I read this post a couple of weeks ago but after writing up the link to the Chuck Klosterman interview, I was reminded of it.  

Not only does M.G. Siegler cram in a nod to The Tragically Hip, he highlights the importance of being able to take the long view of something when forming an opinion and links it to the idea of being on the right side of history.  

I agree and would go even further to suggest it is important to distinguish between what you *want* to happen  and what is the *most likely* thing to happen. If you can make that distinction it might give you an opportunity to reflect on why there is a difference between the two.
