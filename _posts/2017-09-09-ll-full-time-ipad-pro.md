> And now, just over a decade later, I am staring at this iPad Pro and thinking to myself: this is the same jump I made back in 2004. Yes, there will be somethings which won’t work, but I jumped because I knew that I had found the future of computing and I didn’t want to stay on the old crap I had before.

I share this feeling of looking at iOS and knowing it is the future of computing - or at least what I want it to be like. Aside from the Mac mini running headless in our basement and my work computer that is not used outside of work, all of my computing is done on iOS. I do not think this transition is going to be an easy or straight-forward one but I am fairly sure it will come quicker than I expect.
