I found there was a lot of music I missed in 2020. Some of it I just missed... some of it I totally listened to but because, well... because it was 2020, I just completely forgot about it. I went through some other peopleâ€™s top lists and found some pretty stuff that I missed. I wrote more about it in the newsletter, but most of the tracks below are ones that I, as the kids say, slept on.

This playlist is a part of a music newsletter Iâ€™ve started called Notes on Notes. Check out the [newsletter here](https://notesnotes.substack.com/). Of course itâ€™s on Substack.
