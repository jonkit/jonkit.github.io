Here's the fifth <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/in-my-queue-005/pl.u-b3qPGecyK8oqq">In My Queue</a> playlist: 

1. bÃ¼low - Lost
2. Bright Eyes - Miracle of Life
3. Tokyo Police Club - Rubber Bands
4. Delaney Jane - Just as Much (feat. Virginia To Vegas)
5. DVBBS - Need U
6. K.Flay - Self Esteem
7. Foxes - Hollywood
8. Sir Sly - Little Deaths
9. Ryan Adams - Birmingham

<br />
Getting close to the year-end wrap-up but for now a few tracks that have been in my ears for the last little while. That DVBBS track isnâ€™t new but it came up in a recent Apple Music playlist and I was reminded how much I enjoyed listening to it. New-ish tracks from Ryan Adams, TPC, Foxes, and Sir Sly round out a bit of eclectic mix.

This playlist is a part of a music newsletter Iâ€™ve started called Notes on Notes. Check out the [newsletter here](https://notesnotes.substack.com/). Of course itâ€™s on Substack.
