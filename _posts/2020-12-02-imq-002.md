I looked at a bunch of new cover albums in my newsletter this week and decided to put together a playlist of some of my favourite covers. Ah, nostalgia. 

This playlist is a part of a music newsletter Iâ€™ve started called Notes on Notes. Check out the [newsletter here](https://notesnotes.substack.com/). Of course itâ€™s on Substack.
