I haven’t listened to the full broadcast in a few years... I usually opt for the Howard TV documentary they put together a while back, but every year I re-listen to Stern from Sept 11, 2001. I can remember sitting in my Biology class in high school listening (covertly, as always) to it unfold live. It’s surreal, still. What a tremendous broadcast.
