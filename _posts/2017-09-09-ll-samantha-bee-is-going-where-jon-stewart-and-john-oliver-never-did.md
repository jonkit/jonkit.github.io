> It also marked a substantial break from tradition, even if it didn’t seem like it. For the most part, The Daily Show and its children (a family tree Full Frontal belongs to, along with HBO’s Last Week Tonight With John Oliver) have done their best to appear at least slightly objective.

I do like Samantha Bee’s Show. I had a hard time with its break from having a host sit behind a desk but once I got over that I really found her commentary to be more pointed than what I was used to with The Daily Show. 

I do disagree with lumping in Last Week Tonight With John Oliver in terms of being slightly objective. John Oliver is anything but objective in most of his segments.
