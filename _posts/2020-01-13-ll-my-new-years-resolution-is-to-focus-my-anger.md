Recently, I've found myself thinking about something similar - that you don’t have to have an opinion about everything; you can acknowledge that some things exist without having to weigh in on their merit. 

Similar to what Brent is writing about, it's a matter of recognizing that I have limits on my time and the allocation of my emotions... or at least I should have. It gives me a sense of freedom to *not care* about everything.
