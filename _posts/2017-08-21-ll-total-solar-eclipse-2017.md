> The eclipse — the first to cross the U.S. coast to coast in 99 years — will also provide a celestial show to people north of the border, though the partial eclipse visible in Canada won't be quite so striking.

Not that anyone needed a reminder, but today is the day. I’ll only be seeing about 70% coverage but am still excited. There are [many guides](http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/total-eclipse-of-the-sun-2017/) you [can access](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/interactive_map/index.html) to check the time and amount of coverage for wherever you live. 

There are also [more than](http://www.newyorker.com/sections/tech/watch-our-live-stream-of-the-2017-total-solar-eclipse) a few [live streams](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/aug-21-eclipse-up-close-and-personal-with-nasa) probably worth checking out.
