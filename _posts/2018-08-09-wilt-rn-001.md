For the n-teenth time, I’m trying out publishing a playlist on a fairly regular basis sharing the songs I’m listing to. 

Here’s the first[^1-wilt001] [What I’m Listening To Right Now](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/playlist/wilt-current/pl.u-Ym75xPCPgEl99) playlist: 

1. Reuben and the Dark - Bobcaygeon
2. Dermot Kennedy - Young & Free
3. Coleman Hell - Manic
4. Donovan Woods - Next Year
5. Explosions In The Sky - Your Hand In Mine
6. Aquilo - Thin
7. Legendcast - Grief  
  
  
<br />
This group of tracks definitely trended towards a more indie folk vibe... I’ve been listening to a lot of that recently. The whole Donovan Woods album is pretty good but Next Year stood out for me for a number of reasons that I don’t want to detail. The Reuben and the Dark track is a cover[^2-wilt001] and it’s not as good as the original but it came up in my new releases and I’ve gone back to it more than a few times. The last two tracks came from a playlist in the Focus section on Apple Music. They’re preceded by an Explosions In Sky song that is from the Friday Night Lights (tv show) soundtrack... I’ve recently been rewatching the show and felt it worth including alongside those two tracks.

[^1-wilt001]: it’s likely the 7th or 8th playlist, not the 1st... but who’s counting?

[^2-wilt001]: You knew that, right?
