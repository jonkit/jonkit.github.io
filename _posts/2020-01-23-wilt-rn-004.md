Here's the fourth <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/wilt-rn-004/pl.u-LdX0P3tx21Jee">What I'm Listening To Right Now</a> playlist: 

1. DVBBS - Need U
2. Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens - Gone
3. Billie Eilish & Justin Bieber - bad guy
4. Tegan and Sara - I'll Be Back Someday
5. The 1975 - People
6. The Glorious Sons - The Ongoing Speculation Into the Death of Rock and Roll
7. Tokyo Police Club - Hot Tonight

<br />
Itâ€™s been a while and Iâ€™ve had some of these tracks sitting here waiting to go for a while. High percentage of CanCon as well, never a bad thing.
