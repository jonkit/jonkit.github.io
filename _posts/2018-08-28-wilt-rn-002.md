Hereâ€™s the second [What Iâ€™m Listening To Right Now](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/playlist/wilt-rn-002/pl.u-RR6WGDT3maEvv) playlist: 

1. bÃ¼low - Not a Love Song
2. Delaney Jane - Bad Habits
3. Metric - Dressed to Suppress
4. CHVRCHES - Graffiti
5. Rhye - Phoenix
6. The 1975 - TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME
7. Frank Turner - 1933
8. Reuben and the Dark - Heart in Two

I am not surprised that it only took two playlists for me to show my heavy bias for female-led pop/indie/electronic artists. I am also not surprised that the 50% of this playlist is exactly that... every week my For You playlist on Apple Music is basically 40% female-led bands, 30% Dallas Green, 20%  Canadian Indie, and 10% pop and/or folksy acoustic stuff.
