This is my website. I use it to share miscellaneous media that I enjoy and/or consider noteworthy. Occasionally I may write things. It has been set-up to be as hands-off and low-maintenance as possible. Sorry if you expected fancy. If you wish to [contact me](mailto:msg@theonlysiteever.com), please feel free.  

Relevant technical and logistical information that one might find interesting:  

+ This page is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)  
+ It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as the blogging engine  
+ I track basic statistics using [Clicky](http://clicky.com) for no other reason than to see if people are actually visiting the website  
+ I followed an assortment of [how-tos](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2016/04/03/static-and-free.html), [guides](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), and [walkthroughs](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) to set-up and tweak the site but started with the [poole GitHub repo](https://github.com/poole)  
+ Content is written and posted exclusively from [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/) with my [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/) and [iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/) using [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) and [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)  
+ Photos are taken with those two devices and occasionally my camera, an [Olympus OMD-E10](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m10). Edits are made using [VSCO](https://vsco.co/store/app)
